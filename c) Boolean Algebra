---------What is Boolean Algebra?----------

Boolean Algebra is a branch of algebra that deals with binary variables and logical operations. 
  
Unlike regular algebra where variables can have a wide range of values, in Boolean algebra, variables can only have two values:

1 1 (True)

0 0 (False)

It’s the mathematical language behind logic gates, digital circuits, and computer operations. Every digital system — from a simple calculator to a complex processor — uses Boolean algebra to perform decisions, comparisons, and control flow.
