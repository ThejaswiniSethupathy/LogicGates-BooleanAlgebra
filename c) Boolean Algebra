---------What is Boolean Algebra?----------

Boolean Algebra is a branch of algebra that deals with binary variables and logical operations. 
  
Unlike regular algebra where variables can have a wide range of values, in Boolean algebra, variables can only have two values:

1 1 (True)

0 0 (False)

It’s the mathematical language behind logic gates, digital circuits, and computer operations. Every digital system — from a simple calculator to a complex processor — uses Boolean algebra to perform decisions, comparisons, and control flow.

---------Boolean Laws--------

Just like arithmetic algebra, Boolean algebra has laws and rules to simplify expressions. These are helpful when optimizing logic circuits.

-------Identity Laws--------

A + 0 = A

A · 1 = A

--------Null Laws---------

A + 1 = 1

A · 0 = 0

-------Idempotent Laws-------

A + A = A

A · A = A

-------Complement Laws--------

A + A̅ = 1

A · A̅ = 0

---------Involution Law--------

(A̅)̅ = A

--------Commutative Laws-------

A + B = B + A

A · B = B · A

--------Associative Laws---------

A + (B + C) = (A + B) + C

A · (B · C) = (A · B) · C

----------Distributive Laws--------

A · (B + C) = A·B + A·C

A + (B·C) = (A + B)(A + C)

---------De Morgan’s Theorems---------

These are key for simplifying logic expressions using NAND and NOR gates:

(A · B)̅ = A̅ + B̅

(A + B)̅ = A̅ · B̅

---------Consensus Theorem----------

The Consensus Theorem is a simplification rule in Boolean algebra that allows us to eliminate redundant terms in a Boolean expression without changing its output.

------------Applications of Boolean Algebra-----------

Digital Circuit Design: Simplifying logic circuits to reduce gate count.

Programming Conditions: If-else logic uses Boolean logic behind the scenes.

Control Systems: Boolean logic helps in designing decision-based automation systems.

Error Detection: Parity bits and checksums use Boolean operations.

---------Example----------

Expression: A·(B + A)

Using Distributive Law:
= A·B + A·A

Using Idempotent Law:
= A·B + A

Using Absorption Law:
= A
