Logic gates are the basic building blocks of digital circuits. They are electronic components that perform logical operations on one or more binary inputs to produce a single binary output. In simple terms, a logic gate takes in 1s and 0s (representing true and false) and gives an output based on a specific logic rule.

These gates are used in everything from calculators and computers to microcontrollers and digital watches. Each type of gate follows a truth table, which lists all possible input combinations and the corresponding output.

There are several basic logic gates, including:

1. AND gate

2.OR gate

3. NOT gate

4. NAND gate

5. NOR gate

6. XOR gate

7. XNOR gate

Each of these gates plays a unique role in building complex digital systems, and they all operate using principles of Boolean algebra.
