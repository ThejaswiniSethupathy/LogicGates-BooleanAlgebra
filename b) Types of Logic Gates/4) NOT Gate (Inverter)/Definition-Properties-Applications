--------Definition--------

The NOT gate has only one input and it inverts the input: if input is 1, output is 0, and vice versa.

--------Properties--------

Only gate with one input.

Repeated NOT operations return the original value:

NOT(NOT A) = A

--------Applications--------

Used in control logic (like turning off a function if a condition is met).

Acts as a signal inverter.

Common in buffers, memory, and timing circuits.
