--------Definition--------

A NAND gate gives the opposite of the AND gate. It outputs 0 only if all inputs are 1.

--------Properties--------

Universal gate â€“ any logic circuit can be built using only NAND gates.

Inverts the output of an AND gate.

--------Applications--------

Memory elements (like SR latch).

Basic building block in digital ICs.

Used in alarm systems, multiplexers, and switching logic.
