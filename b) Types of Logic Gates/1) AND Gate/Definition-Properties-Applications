-------Definition:---------

The AND gate outputs 1 (true) only if all inputs are 1. It mimics the logical operation A AND B.

--------Properties:--------
  
Output is high only when all inputs are high.

It is commutative and associative:

A AND B = B AND A

(A AND B) AND C = A AND (B AND C)

--------Applications:---------

Used in security systems (e.g., both doors must be closed to trigger an alarm).

Bitwise operations in programming.

Logic-based decision making in microprocessors.
