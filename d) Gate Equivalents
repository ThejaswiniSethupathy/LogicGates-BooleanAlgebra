---------What Are Gate Equivalents?-----------
  
Gate equivalents refer to the alternate ways of implementing a logic gate or a logic function using a different set of basic gates â€” typically NAND or NOR, which are known as universal gates.

In digital design, understanding gate equivalency helps:

Minimize hardware cost

Optimize circuits

Build any circuit using a limited type of gate (especially NAND or NOR)

--------Universal Gates---------
  
NAND and NOR are called universal gates because you can build any other gate using just NANDs or just NORs.

This is helpful in real-world digital circuits where manufacturing uses a fixed gate type to simplify IC design.
